This project solves the problem that occurs due to crowing in public places some people among the crowd do not wear a face mask, or they don't carry a face mask with them the website recognizes such faces and notifies them with an alerting sound saying "mask alert" until and unless they don't wear the mask.
moreover, a few more tabs have been added such as upload vaccination certificates where one can upload the certificate and the authorities can verify their certificates.
there is a contact tab that helps the user to share their problems, quey and they can reach out anytime to the concerned authority by filling in their details and message box their respective queries
there is a tutorial tab in which there are some protocols mentioned that need to be followed when exposed to the crowd and to make ourselves safe from the coronavirus
the main function of the project is there which works as soon as we enable the webcam it will take a few seconds to detect the face of the person and produces a notification sounds of "mask alert" if there is no mask and make the meter of no mask to be 1. If the person is wearing the mask then the masking meter becomes 1 and there is no notification sound 
by refreshing the page it gets backs to the home screen
